Hexagram uses LLMs to generate example sentences and stories for Chinese Anki vocabulary cards.

[It is available for MacOS.](https://github.com/nichwch/hexagram/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

To get started, you need to set up [AnkiConnect.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

Once you've set up AnkiConnect, you need to go to the add on configs and set "webCorsOriginList" to include "tauri://localhost".
