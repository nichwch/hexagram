Hexagram uses LLMs to generate example sentences for Chinese Anki vocabulary cards.

To get started, you need to set up [AnkiConnect.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

Once you've set up AnkiConnect, you need to go to the add on configs and set "webCorsOriginList" to include "http://localhost:1420".
